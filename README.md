# Players App
I created an API with ExpressJS to return a JSON data to an Angular App that list football players.

### The app main features:
* Filter searching by name or team
* Pagination
* Change the order of results

### I've used for this project:
* Bootstrap
* ExpressJS
* Typescript
* Angular 7
* RXJS

## Angular App
Look the [readme](https://github.com/rafaelperozin/players-app/tree/master/AngularApp) file on Angular App folder to know how to install and use the app.

## API
Look the [readme](https://github.com/rafaelperozin/players-app/tree/master/ExpressServer) file on ExpressServer folder to know how to install and use the API.
