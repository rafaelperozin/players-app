# Players App
I created an API with ExpressJS to return a JSON data to an Angular App that list football players.

### The app main features:
* Filter searching by name or team
* Pagination
* Change the order of results

### I've used for this project:
* Bootstrap
* ExpressJS
* Typescript
* Angular 7
* RXJS

## STEP BY STEP
1. Clone the repository
2. In the ExpressServer folder run ``` npm install ```
3. In the AngularApp folder run ``` npm install ```
4. Back to the ExpressServer run ``` node server.js ```
5. In the AngularApp folder run ``` ng serve ```
6. Open http://localhost:42000
